Welcome to Build-a-School.  Together, we're going to try and make the school of the future more efficient, more student-friendly, and able to provide an environment within which each teacher can give their students the best learning environment possible.

It's going to take a little work of course.  As you probably know, it's not easy to plan a school.

But don't worry.

I'll help, and it will be easier than you think.

Ready to get started?

** Let's go! **

# Step 1
#### Great!
#### First, we're going to need to know a little bit about your school.
#### How many students do you think you'll have at this school next year, on average?
#####  _Number_
###### Don't worry about specifics.  We're going to make a rough sketch of your school, so you can color it in later.  For now, we just need generalities.

#### Second, how many of those students -- on average -- will be in a classroom at the same time? 
##### _Number_

#### Thank you!
#### Third, how would you like to divide up the school day?
##### _Number_ Class Periods * + * _Number_ Free Periods

#### Here's a rough sketch of your school!

##### It's pretty rough, so maybe we should play with it a bit.

> This is where the picture of the school ingrains itself into the background, looking a bit more like a drawing.
> It should be a bit rough, with an unfinished look.

#### So, lets put some rooms in your school.
##### Try pulling on this tab.

###### Here's where you can find the rooms for your school.
###### Underneath a picture of each room is a general category of "type" of room.  There's also a special category of room that you can name and classify yourself if you want.
###### So!  Go ahead and start dropping rooms into your school.

> At this point, the user should be left to their own devices.  The school shows slightly sectioned off areas, indicating that those are the places that the rooms from the tray on the left should be dropped into.
> It may also be a good idea to have a counter on the screen.  Maybe just a basic "6 Periods to fill!" thing that counts down as they place rooms.
> Then, once all the rooms have been filled, the next phase begins.

#### The sketch of your school is looking a bit better.
#### I think it would be fun to start coloring in the rooms.
##### But if you want to see the numbers behind your sketch so far, you should pull that tab on the right.

> On the right is a tab that opens up the drawer for the numbers breakdown.  This is where the user can see things like FTE required.  Only the numbers that are calculable from the data we've already collected is shown.  So the further the user gets in the program, the more caluclations are shown.
> This also might be a good time to introduce a "Start Over" button somewhere.  Though it shouldn't be too prominent, since we don't actually want them to start over until they've gone far enough to see that we'll be showing them alternative setups to their own.
