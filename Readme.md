# MEAN seed
This is meant to help get a full application stack up and running with little effort.
Components being leverage on the server-side:
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* Recess
* Jade
* Grunt (for watching and recompiling less and jade files)

And on the client-side:
* AngularJS
* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* RequireJS

## To make use of this seed:
> git clone https://github.com/lightlystarched/mean-seed [your path]
> cd [your path]
> npm install && bower install
And now you're good to go!

To run your test server and watch for changes, type:
> grunt

Then just navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000/
